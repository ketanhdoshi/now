## Overview of how Optimization is done in a Neural Network

Picture of Model Parameters. Parameter Groups showing a CNN section and a Linear Classifier section which are put into different Parameter Groups. Training Hyperparameters like Learning Rate, Momentume Rate etc. Then show where the Optimizer comes in - what inputs do they take and what they are updating. Then show where Schedulers come in - what inputs do they take and what are they updating.

## Quick Summary of popular Optimizers and Schedulers

## Conclusion
